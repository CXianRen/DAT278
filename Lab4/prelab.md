+ What is energy delay product.

it is a metric to describe, to evaluate the overall energy effeicency and performance of a chip/program/. EDP = enery * delay. where
the time refers to the time it takes to perform a specific operation.

+ How do frequency and voltage affect dynamic power ?

because dynamic power = C x V^2 x f.
if we want to lower the dynamic power, we can lower the 
V(voltage) or f(frequency). And we should know that if we lower the 
voltage, it also means that the speed of CMOS is going down to therefore, frequency should be lower too.
